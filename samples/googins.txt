There was no one there to pick up the rucksack, to pick up the boat, to pick up the log, to go in there. It was you! It's you against you. You against you. There was no fucking team. It was you. There was no weight loss program or mom and dad waking you up and saying, "You can do it, you can be better," trying to build belief. You built belief when you had nothing. Rock bottom. So if you wake up in the morning and you don't want to do something, you don't care enough about yourself. And that's what you need to really research is, "Man, why am I not doing this for myself?" Because that is, that is the number one purpose in life, is to better oneself. I've trained ninety-nine percent of my life alone. No one had me on their back. I did all of the work alone.
